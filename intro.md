Web application testsing might be tedious, but we still need it. In the informal articale I will try to introduce SWAT - a simple web application test framework as an attempt to reduce test devlopment compelxity and speed up of development process.

The idea behind swat is quite simple. Instead of going with unit tests and interact with your application in internal level one should look at application like black box. All we could with it - is to send some http requests and anulize an output.
